# TeacherPlan

#### Consdiderations ####

I have been studying django by myself in my free time for the past few months. I am finishing a degree as a developer on a full time schedule, the focus of this course was on Java, PHP and JavaScript. 

I'm very keen on python and django, the language and the framework have something special that others don't. This project is still ongoing and it is not finished. This is an opportunity to practice what I've learned about python and django in my free time.

I know my code isn't the cleanest yet and when I finally realized the complexity of this project (for a beginner of course) I halted the coding for a little while so I could focus on learning about TDD in Django and to read Kent Back's "Test-Driven Development by Example", so I can come back fresh and with a cleaner approach.

I aspire to become a backend developer so please don't mind my front-end.

I've been rethinking this project's structure, as django, as well as python are versatile and there are no imposed structures, only prescribed ones, it is hard to know if my app's structure is correct or not. I chose to slice it in 5 apps so I could atomize and separate so it would be easier to manage so many moving parts, but coming this far I see that it could possibly be reduced to 3 apps.


#### About this project ###

This project aims to simplify my wife's organization and access to her lesson plans and feedback (and maybe one day when this project succeeds to other teachers as well). As the years passed, the "database" my wife uses has got bigger and bigger, as of today she does a marvelous job with google sheet pages, easy to use and to find what you want, but slow and you need to know in which file the information is. It has been working very well for her, but there is a lot of human work put into saving, retrieving and reusing lesson plans for future lessons, as many components of a lesson plan and feedback can be reused.


#### Future ideas this project ####


- Connection to google calendar API for retrieving and import automatically the future lessons
- Adding groups so a teacher working for a company can see all students from that company and all lesson plans from other teachers
